Based on what he said in class:
- more mature project title
- more details about idea of project
- talk about new or fun aspects, user interaction, dynamic behavior in terms of data base queries, etc
- suggested that it's useful to have a diagram (ex: mock front-end) but NOT NECESSARY
- references from text about technical aspects (see galileo or something, i guess)
- optional: brief plan for milestones, a timeline, etc
