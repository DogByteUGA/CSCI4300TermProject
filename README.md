THE PLAN

By next Wednesday (April 1st), we should have the basic design of our pages completed.
<br>
<br>Put your name next to to what you'd like to work on so we can all know what we need to do.

There will be five parts to work on:

1. <b>Welcome Page</b>: needs sign-in area (username/password), which sends user to Project Search Page after login, also has link to Sign-Up Form (1 page) <b><i>Tiffany</i></b>

2. <b>Sign-up Form</b>: (linked from Welcome Page) that goes to a created User Profile* when completed (2 pages)

3. <b>Project Creation Form</b>*: (linked from User Profile) that goes to a create Project Profile* when completed (2 pages), generating a new link to this on the User Profile. There should also be a link back to the user who created the project.

4. <b>Project Search Page</b>*: all the available projects on the website (1 page)

5. <b>Top Navigation Bar</b>: Should read "Welcome, Username!" , "My Profile" (link to User Profile), "Search Projects" (Link to Search Projects) on the pages noted by *. This should only be seen by logged in users. <b><i>Tiffany</i></b>
