By next Wednesday (April 1st), we should have the design of our pages completed.
There will be four parts to work on:

1. Welcome Page: needs sign-in area (username/password), which sends user to Project Search Page after login, also has link to Sign-Up Form (1 page)

2. Sign-up Form (linked from Welcome Page) that goes to a created User Profile* when completed (2 pages)

3. Project Creation Form* (linked from User Profile) that goes to a create Project Profile* when completed (2 pages), generating a new link to this on the User Profile

4. Project Search Page*: all the available projects on the website (1 page)

5: Top Navigation Bar: "Welcome, Username!" "My Profile" (link to User Profile) "Search Projects" (Link to Search Projects) for logged-in user relevant pages only, noted by *
