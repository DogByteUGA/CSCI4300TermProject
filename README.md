THE PLAN

By next Wednesday (April 1st), we should have the design of our pages completed.
Put your name next to to what you'd like to work on so we can all know what we need to do.

There will be five parts to work on:

1. Welcome Page: needs sign-in area (username/password), which sends user to Project Search Page after login, also has link to Sign-Up Form (1 page) <b><i>Tiffany</i></b>

2. Sign-up Form (linked from Welcome Page) that goes to a created User Profile* when completed (2 pages)

3. Project Creation Form* (linked from User Profile) that goes to a create Project Profile* when completed (2 pages), generating a new link to this on the User Profile. There should also be a link back to the user who created the project.

4. Project Search Page*: all the available projects on the website (1 page)

5. Top Navigation Bar: "Welcome, Username!" "My Profile" (link to User Profile) "Search Projects" (Link to Search Projects) for logged-in user relevant pages only, noted by * <b><i>Tiffany</i></b>
