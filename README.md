Term Project

--Step 1: Design--

By next Wednesday (April 1st), we should have the basic design of our pages completed.
<br>
<br>Put your name next to to what you'd like to work on so we can all know what we need to do.

There will be five parts to work on:

1. <b>Welcome Page</b>: needs sign-in area (username/password), which sends user to Project Search Page after login, also has link to Sign-Up Form (1 page) <b><i>Tiffany</i></b>

2. <b>Sign-up Form</b>: (linked from Welcome Page) that goes to a created User Profile when completed (2 pages) <b><i>MIKE</i></b>

3. <b>Project Creation Form</b>: (linked from User Profile) that goes to a create Project Profile* when completed (2 pages), generating a new link to this on the User Profile. There should also be a link back to the user who created the project. <b><i>Dionte'</i></b>

4. <b>Project Search Page</b>: all the available projects on the website (1 page)RYAN

5. <b>Top Navigation Bar</b>: Should read "Welcome, Username!" and have the following options: 
<br>"My Profile" (link to User Profile)
<br>"Search Projects" (Link to Search Projects) 
<br>on the pages noted below. This should only be seen by logged in users. <b><i>Tiffany</i></b>

Pages that have top navigation bar:
<ul>
<li>User Profile Page
<li>Project Creation Page
<li>Project Profile Page
<li>Project Search Page
</ul>

Again, this is only design. Don't worry about what the pages are going to actually do yet (for example: if your page links to someone else's, only worry about your own). Make sure to use UGA colors and put your pages up on GitHub when you're done so we can look at them.

--Step 2: Functionality--

By next Monday (April 13), we should be able to go through our website like the users can. What I mean is that we should be able to click through the site with the top bar and through links without any hassle.
So that basically means that we need the site to be functional and useable. Everyone should make sure that whatever page they worked on links correctly to the other pages as outlined above.

I'd like for us to tackle the harder things, like implementing the APIs (Maps, Twitter? for updates) and User Profile pages (getting the information) together so one person won't be bogged down with something heavy.
